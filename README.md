## Description:

As a graduation project, I wanted to share the details of the android application we made with teammates. The main goal of our application is to show the voice command feature that makes huge differences when it is added, although it is very simple for the visually impaired people, unlike the audiobook applications that exist in today's world, and to raise awareness for visually impaired people.

Our application consists of an intro and 2 activities. Apart from these, there is an admin control panel for SQL control. The image you see above shows our intro, home page, and the book player screen where the selected book can be listened to. When the user clicks anywhere on the screen, the application starts listening. Users can reach the books and authors registered in the database by giving their voice commands. The book is opened with the name of the book and the user enjoys the book.

On the book player screen, the book starts playing by itself and stops when the user touches the screen. The user simply needs to touch the screen again to continue listening. Just like on the main page, the user can give a voice command to the application by pressing the screen. The commands that he can give are to take the book forward or backward or to return to the main page. The book continues where the user left off after opening the book again.

The most important feature that distinguishes our application from other applications is that it can be voice commanded and it is user-friendly by asking "Did you mean" question to the user.
